##  :beginner: About
I was pretty amused of how little libraries there wore to make C websites so i decided to make my own, i guess this is not recommended to use for any commercial application as there could be lots and lots of bugs and its easier to use nods.js anyways but i think this is pretty cool and i am learning a lot on it and so could you.

## :zap: Usage
To use this project you only have to copy the "cwl.c" and "cwl.h" files and then you're good to go coding your very own C websites.

###  :package: Commands
To run the server its as easy as to just run "gcc ./*.c -o server" and then just run the server app

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

No other branches should be created in the main repository, you need to fork the repo to work on it, then create 


**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to the main repo.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
